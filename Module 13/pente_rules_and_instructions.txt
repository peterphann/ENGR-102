INSTRUCTIONS:
1. To place a stone, players must enter a letter (A-S) and number (1-19) corresponding to a square on the board.
   For example, entering 'A1' would place a tile in the top left corner of the board.
2. To quit the game, press 'Q'.

RULES:
1. Players take turns (Player 1 going first) placing stones of their color on empty intersections. 
2. Stones are captured by custodial capture (flanking an adjacent pair of an opponent's stones directly on either side with your own stones). 
   Captures consist of exactly two stones; flanking a single stone or three or more stones does not result in a capture.
   A stone may legally be placed on any empty intersection, even if it forms a pair between two enemy stones.
3. A player wins when they either align five or more stones of the some color in a row (in any vertical, horixontal or diagonal direction) or make 5 captures (10 stones).
